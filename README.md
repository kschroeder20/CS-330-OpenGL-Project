# CS-330-OpenGL-Project

## How do I approach designing software?
### - What new design skills have your work on the project helped you to craft?
I've gained experience in developing computer graphics and breaking down real-life images into primitive shapes.


### - What design process did you follow for your project work?
I tried to modularize my code as much as possible. I abstracted most of the VBO and VAO setup to functions in the Source.cpp file and I abstracted more complex functionality like camera movement and cylinder creation to different files.

### - How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I think that modularizing code is helpful in all assets of computer science to make code more readable.


## How do I approach developing programs?
### - What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Again, I tried to focus on modularizing my code and not repeating myself when I could avoid it.

### - How did iteration factor into your development?
I was able to make camera and cylinder functions reusable so I could call them frequently without repeating myself.

### - How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
When I was developing my first object (the pencil) I didn't fully understand how to move objects in my world using translations, scales, rotation, etc. Once I learned that I relied less on the vertex points to direct the objects, which lead to cleaner and more reusable code.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
### - How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
It gave me a lot of C++ work that I was rusty on. Our program uses C++ a lot, so it was good to get a refresher.

### - How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
I don't see that happening because I am not interested in going into graphic design... but you never know.
